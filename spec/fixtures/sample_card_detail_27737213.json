Remove the buttons for the bonus and just have clickable text that says something like: \"Choose My Bonus\" or \"Select a Bonus\" (that opens the modal window when clicked).  It would need to have an option below with the ability to select \"I don't want a bonus\" so that people don't have to open the modal window if they don't want a bonus.\n\n2. If they click \"Choose My Bonus\" it brings up the modal window just as you have it now, but in this case I think we could put \"No Bonus\" at the bottom instead.\n\n3. Display the bonus they have selected once the modal window is closed, but don't show the bonus amount i.e. it would show \"100% Sports Bonus up to $200\", but wouldn't show only $150 if they have selected that as the deposit amount.  We think that could actually maybe work against us with the current Untracked 10% bonus, because someone would see \"Sportsbook Bonus $2\" if they make a $20 deposit which might not look very good. \n\nOnce we have the opt-in live I can look at A/B testing the Untracked bonus again.  It did not improve conversions when we tested it at 100% (vs 10%) in the past, but once we have the opt-in it will be easier to test again because people will be able to opt-out of the 100% - right now they wouldn't be able to and would be locked in at a 10x rollover if we automatically give them a 100% bonus (vs the current 3x rollover for the 10% bonus)","recipients":["Eyal Blecher <417139>","Niels O'Flanagan <261430>","Richie Grant <262362>","Susan  Gahan <575124>"],"created_at":"2020-02-05T02:13:54.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-02-05T02:13:54.000+00:00","deleted_at":null,"attachments":[]},{"id":4128839,"user_id":575124,"commentable_version":48,"content":" ![Choosing a bonus 4.jpg](https://fusioneer.kanbantool.com/system/attachments/l4Rz5VtcGh8/Choosing%20a%20bonus%204.jpg#3671863)  ![Choosing a bonus 5.jpg](https://fusioneer.kanbantool.com/system/attachments/E1ktpFFRFtw/Choosing%20a%20bonus%205.jpg#3671865) \nVersions 4 and 5 attached.
