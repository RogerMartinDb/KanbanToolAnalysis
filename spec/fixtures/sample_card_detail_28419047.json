This fields meaning is the date and time at which the countdown was started for that entry(if multiple entries on bet card this date would be the same on all bets in the bet card)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>FIRST CALL</strong></p><p>- when a place bet button is pressed we check if we have any live bets on the bet card</p><p>&nbsp; - if true we calculate the delay based on all exceptions present</p><p>&nbsp; - if not true we return a delay length of 0 to the frontend (automatically places the bet in the current session)</p><p>- if the delay length in the step above is positive (&gt;0) we set the date_begin_place_live_bet field to the current time on all entries of the bet card</p><p>- otherwise we reset all these dates to be empty</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SECOND CALL</strong></p><p>- The frontend after the delay in secconds we return from the first call automatically does another call to the endpoint used in the first call</p><p>- We call the same backend code as above but this time the code hits an escape condition which then proceeds to continue the place bet procedure and finish placing the bet. This condition is:&nbsp;</p><p><em>date_begin_place_live_bet &amp;&amp; (date_begin_place_live_bet + delay_in_seconds).past? .&nbsp;</em>Which checks that the countdown started already and that the countdown start time + the <strong>recalculated</strong> delay in seconds is in the past (the countdown is over).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p>The problem is question arises because of the fact that we don't check both bounds of the countdown timer (we only check that the timer finished sometimes in the past, not that it finished in the <strong>recent&nbsp;</strong>past). I think we should also store when the countdown should finish and include that in the check above (also giving it some leeway)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Test</strong></p><p>- login</p><p>- add a live bet to your bet card&nbsp;</p><p>- place the bet &amp; wait for the countdown to start&nbsp;</p><p>- immediately close the tab where the countdown is running</p><p>- wait until the countdown would've finished (or more)</p><p>- press place bet again (the bet will go through today. It should start the countdown again and it should not place the bet if the price has changed (more than 10%) since the last place bet click)</p>","position":4,"priority":0,"tags":"","created_at":"2020-01-22T18:41:44.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-06-03T13:15:53.000+01:00","board_version":20072,"archived_at":"2020-06-03T13:15:53.000+01:00","assigned_user_id":417139,"comments_count":9,"size_estimate":"1.0","card_type_id":3108316,"subtasks_count":0,"subtasks_completed_count":0,"attachments_count":1,"custom_field_1":null,"custom_field_2":null,"custom_field_3":null,"custom_field_4":null,"custom_field_5":null,"custom_field_6":null,"custom_field_7":null,"custom_field_8":null,"custom_field_9":null,"custom_field_10":null,"custom_field_11":null,"custom_field_12":null,"custom_field_13":null,"custom_field_14":null,"custom_field_15":null,"external_link":"https://harmonycourt.basecamphq.com/projects/12363802-it-maintenance/todo_items/237765575/comments#406880350","due_date":null,"postponed_until":null,"swimlane_id":1396901,"external_id":null,"subtask_search_tags":null,"block_reason":null,"created_by_id":417139,"time_estimate":null,"timers_total":null,"timers_total_updated_at":"2020-06-03T13:15:53.000+01:00","timers_active_count":0,"timers_listed_count":0,"timers_postponed_count":0,"linked_tasks":null,"linked_tasks_status":null,"linked_from":null,"card_color":"carrot","card_color_in_rgb":"#FF5722","card_color_invert":true,"size_estimate_description":"1.0 -

I think it's the only easy solution. \n\nI'm thinking we should go ahead and do that now.\n\nIt still does mean that someone with a fast feed can cancel their bet if they see something bad for their runner during the countdown, giving them an unfair advantage, but that is probably rare. It also means we are using some fixed time logic, which is never nice. We could ask Denis how important the risk is where we are allowing people to cancel bets during countdown.
