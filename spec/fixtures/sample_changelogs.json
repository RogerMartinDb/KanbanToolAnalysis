But it appears to be classified as a Casino promo card. The casino pages for the 2 clients i have tested with so far are pulling this card into 1 of the 2 promos at the base of the page, i would assume it is because it is the first in the list.  \n\nSo my question is whether this is correct? Would we want a RAF promo to always be 1 of the 2 cards present"
